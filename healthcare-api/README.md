# Healthcare Services API

This is a simple API for managing healthcare services using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) healthcare services.

## Features

- Add a new healthcare service
- Get a list of all healthcare services
- Update an existing healthcare service
- Delete a healthcare service

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** with Express for the backend
- **MongoDB** for the database (using Mongoose as the ORM)
- **Postman** for API testing

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (running locally or using MongoDB Atlas)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (optional, for testing the API)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ameya-kanchan/Healthcare-API.git
cd healthcare-services-api

## ERROR Handling 
The API will return appropriate HTTP status codes for various scenarios:
 - 400 Bad Request if required fields are missing.
 - 404 Not Found if the service with the given ID does not exist.
 - 500 Internal Server Error if thereâ€™s an issue on the server side.

## Testing the API
You can use Postman to test the API. The endpoints can be tested by making HTTP requests to the localhost:3000 server (or the appropriate URL if you deploy the API).
 - Create a service using the POST endpoint.
 - Fetch all services using the GET endpoint.
 - Update a service using the PUT endpoint.
 - Delete a service using the DELETE endpoint.
